# odin-js-restaurant-page
## The Odin Project - Restaurant Page

Project completed as part of The Odin Project. Create a simple restaurant homepage.

## Languages/Technologies used:
 - Javascript/HTML/CSS
 - VS Code
 - Git/Github
 - ESLint
 - Webpack
 - ES6 Modules
 - NPM

## What I learned:
 - How to use Webpack for bundling modules, load CSS/images/fonts, how to use watch mode
 - How to organize my code using ES6 modules - put each tab inside its own module
 - How to create a simple interface using JavaScript alone for DOM manipulation and tabbed browsing

## Still can improve:
 - Kept website very simple, could add more styling
 - The contact.js module code seems a little repetitive, may be a better way to implement that page
